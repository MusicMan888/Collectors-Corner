# collectors-corner

This is a personal project to reinforce TOP concepts and to serve as a prototype for an idea I have to create an on-line site that guitar collectors might use to document and showcase their collections - possibilities are endless - trades, sales, repair and mod histories, etc.

A test site for what I envision to be a full featured on-line application, for the avid guitar collector who would like to document their collection for multiple purposes. Make, manufacturer, serial# and history of each guitar from unboxing to possible sale. Including initial inspection, specifications, initial cost and possible upgrades. Repair and modification history, including photos. 

In a full application, each of the listed guitars (perhaps in columns inside a flex box, would be part of a back end database, the name (and/or photo) would be a clickable link which would load the guitar page - I envision 3 - 4 different pages - main guitar data - initial inspection/setup data - service/mod history/ current setup data.

The index page might link to a photo gallery and a discription of the guitar, then a link to the main ownership record, and another link to the service history, current set up record. It's daunting without a proper database to store the data in tables. With a database, I might only need a few different pages that could be populated with data from the tables. Otherwise the number of pages is excessive
