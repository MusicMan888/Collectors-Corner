    <H1>Welcome to Collectors Corner</H1>
<p> A test site for what I envision to be a full featured on line application, 
    for the avid guitar collector who would like to document their collection 
    for multiple purposes. Make, manufacturer, serial# and history of each guitar 
    from unboxing to possible sale. Including initial inspection, specifications, 
    initial cost and possible upgrades. Repair and modification history, including
    photos.
